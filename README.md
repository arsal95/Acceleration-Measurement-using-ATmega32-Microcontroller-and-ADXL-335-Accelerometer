# Acceleration-Measurement-using-ATmega32-Microcontroller-and-ADXL-335-Accelerometer
This project is a real-time application where the height of the floors was measured in an elevator. The experiment was carried out from the ground floor to the second floor. Multiple trips in the elevator were conducted to ensure data accuracy by comparing each trip and taking the arithmetic mean of all the trips.

For the experiment, all hardware works as a standalone unit including Atmega32 microcontroller, test circuit, acceleration sensor (ADXL355) with the micro SD card and two 6 volt batteries that supplies +6 volts and 
-6 volts. The test should be taped firmly with rectangle wooden block in order to get proper measurement and to do proper calibration after each trip. For data recording the RS232 to micro SD converter. 
As the standalone unit power on the received serial data will start logging on the micro SD card. Original measured data is given below;
