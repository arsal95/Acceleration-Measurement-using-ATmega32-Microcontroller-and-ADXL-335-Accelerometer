# Acceleration-Measurement-using-ATmega32-Microcontroller-and-ADXL-335-Accelerometer
The experiment perform for a real time application in the elevator where the height of the floors are measured. The experiment is performed from ground floor to second floor. For that the multiple trips in an 
elevator are conducted to assure the data value accuracy by comparing the each trip and taking the arithmetic mean of all the trips.

For the experiment, all hardware works as a standalone unit including Atmega32 microcontroller, test circuit, acceleration sensor (ADXL355) with the micro SD card and two 6 volt batteries that supplies +6 volts and 
-6 volts. The test should be taped firmly with rectangle wooden block in order to get proper measurement and to do proper calibration after each trip. For data recording the RS232 to micro SD converter. 
As the standalone unit power on the received serial data will start logging on the micro SD card [5]. Original measured data is given below;
